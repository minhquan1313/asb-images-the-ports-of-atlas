# Ark Species Images

A collection of species images for both Ark: Survival Evolved and Ark: Survival Ascended.
All images consist of a mask and regions so they can be coloured, approximating the look in-game.

## File Naming Scheme

See https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor/wiki/Creating-New-Images#file-names for details of the file
naming scheme within ASB.

As a summary, images must be in matching pairs of base colour (`<filename>.png`) and region mask image
(`<filename>_m.png`), where `<filename>` is made up of the following components:
```
<speciesname>[_<ASE|ASA|modid>][_s(m|f)][_p<pattern>][_v<variant>]
```
* `speciesname` is the display name of the species (as showing in ASB and matching the values JSON)
* `ASE|ASA` may be included to only apply to one version of the game.
* `modid` is a numeric ID - either a Steam Workshop ID (for ASE) or a Curseforge Project ID (for ASA)
* `sm` means Male only while `sf` means Female only
* `pattern` is the pattern index, for example for Cat where they have 6 pattern options
* `variant` is the variant index (an integer >0), this can be used to add multiple creature poses the user can chose from

All elements after `speciesname` are optional. The more elements present, the higher priority it will have.
